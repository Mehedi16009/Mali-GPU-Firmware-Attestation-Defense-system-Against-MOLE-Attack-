# Mali-GPU-Firmware-Attestation-Defense-system-Against-MOLE-Attack-
Prototype implementation of firmware attestation for Mali GPU MCUs â€” demonstrates how cryptographic signing and verification can block MOLE-style attacks by rejecting tampered firmware before execution. Built as a software-only demo in Google Colab using Python + OpenSSL.
